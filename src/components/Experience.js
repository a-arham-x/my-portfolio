            <p>Worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Onebyte. During this internship, I worked with industry
                professionals to provide solution to creating alert queries in Elasticsearch and Opensearch. I also
                worked for the development of an API that manages all the requests to a Hospital Management System's
                server. And I worked for the documentation of HL7 which is a messaging format used for sharing
                information by health care providers.</p>

            <p>During this internship, I alongside my team worked on developing the documentation of a health care
                application. Our goal was to provide a design and architecture solution for a health care application
                that manages a blood donation service and an ambulance service. Working here I learnt how different
                problems are solved in software development and what formats are used for communicating the information
                to the stakeholders.</p>
