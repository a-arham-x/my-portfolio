        <h3>Software Engineer Intern at Onebyte</h3>
        <pre>July 2023 - Auguest 2023</pre>
        <p>
          Worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Onebyte. During this
          internship, I worked with industry professionals to provide solution
          to creating alert queries in Elasticsearch and Opensearch. I also
          worked for the development of an API that manages all the requests to
          a Hospital Management System's server. And I worked for the
          documentation of HL7 which is a messaging format used for sharing
          information by health care providers.

        <h3>Software Engineer Intern at Paakhealth</h3>
        <pre>September 2022 - December 2022</pre>
        <p>
          During this internship, I alongside my team worked on developing the
          documentation of a health care application. Our goal was to provide a
          design and architecture solution for a health care application that
          manages a blood donation service and an ambulance service. Working
          here I learnt how different problems are solved in software
          development and what formats are used for communicating the
          information to the stakeholders.
