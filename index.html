            <p>Worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Onebyte. During this internship, I worked with industry
                professionals to provide solution to creating alert queries in Elasticsearch and Opensearch. I also
                worked for the development of an API that manages all the requests to a Hospital Management System's
                server. And I worked for the documentation of HL7 which is a messaging format used for sharing
                information by health care providers.</p>

            <h3>Software Engineer Intern at Paakhealth</h3>
            <pre>September 2022 - December 2022</pre>
            <p>During this internship, I alongside my team worked on developing the documentation of a health care
                application. Our goal was to provide a design and architecture solution for a health care application
                that manages a blood donation service and an ambulance service. Working here I learnt how different
                problems are solved in software development and what formats are used for communicating the information
                to the stakeholders.</p>

                        <p>A Python Flask Application that has only one form. The form takes in all the values from the
                            user
                            and then predicts the price of house based on the given values. The model is trained using
                            the
                            Regression Trees algorithm. For this purpose, I had used the sklearn library in Python which
                            has
                            many built in functions for the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.</p>

            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p>Reading is one of my favourite things to do. When I say reading, I do not just mean book reading or
                magazines, I also love reading different articles on internet such as those on medium. I always make
                sure
                not to miss any chance of gaining useful knowledge through reading.</p>

            <h3>Watching Shows and Movies</h3>
            <p>In my free time, I often watch different movies and shows, while I have explored different genres, I love
                science fictions movies the most. My favourite movies are Interstelar and The Dark Knight. Other than
                shows
                and movies, I also watch videos about science and math where Varitasium and 3Blue1Brown are my favourite
                channels in science and maths.</p>

            <h3>Coding For Fun</h3>
            <p>While I code for my academics or some important work or developing app for my portfolio, I also code for
                fun
                in my free time. When coding as a hobby, I would just think of something random or some problem and
                start
                working on it. These func projects range from short programs to simple GUI apps. As a by-product, this
                activity helps in my skills development and logic building, and its a good exercise for my mind too,
                isn't
                it?</p>
